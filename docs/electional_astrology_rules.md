**Traditional Electional Astrology – General and Marriage-Specific Rules**
*Compiled from Bonatti, Sahl, Masha’allah, Abu Ma’shar, al-Tabari, Abu Bakr, and later medieval practice.*

---

## **1. General Principles of All Elections**

### **1.1. Election charts must improve the natal promise, not contradict it**

Every election chart is a *temporary nativity*. It **cannot** create what the natal cannot support.
Election is used to **choose the best moment** inside the limits of natal potential.

### **1.2. Priority order of factors**

Based on the medieval hierarchy:

**1. Ascendant and its ruler**
**2. Moon**
**3. Moon’s next application**
**4. Lord of the house ruling the topic**
**5. Benefic/malefic condition**
**6. Position of significators by sign and house**

Everything else is secondary.

### **1.3. Strength is good, but stability is better**

Angular = powerful but volatile
Succedent = stable and enduring
Cadent = weak or disconnected

For marriage, contracts, rituals → **succedent** is often ideal.

### **1.4. Malefics in bad condition ruin elections**

Mars or Saturn:

* retrograde
* combust
* cadent but harming the Moon
* angular and afflicting angles

→ all harmful.

Malefics **in sect**, **dignified**, or **succedent** may assist by “removing impediments.”

### **1.5. Do not allow the Moon to be:**

* Void
* Combust
* Under Saturn’s rays
* Applying to Mars/Saturn without reception
* In the 6th/8th/12th *unless dignified and strategic*

### **1.6. Reception softens all blows**

Any hard aspect between significators is acceptable if:

* they receive each other
* there is a translation or collection by a benefic

Reception turns friction into cooperation.

---

## **2. The Ascendant & Its Ruler**

### **2.1. The Ascendant must be protected**

Avoid having the Asc:

* afflicted by malefics
* in the native’s natal 6th/8th/12th
* conjunct a natal malefic
* conjunct a natal sensitive degree

### **2.2. The ruler of the Ascendant must be:**

At least functional. Ideally:

* Direct
* Not combust
* Not retrograde
* In a good house
* Free from malefics
* Applying to a benefic
* In its own dignity or reception

### **2.3. Avoid early (0–3°) and late (27–29°) degrees**

Unless symbolically desired (rare cases).

---

## **3. The Moon – The Heart of All Elections**

### **3.1. Condition of the Moon**

Prefer:

* fast
* waxing
* in its dignities
* free from malefics

Avoid:

* Moon in 6th/8th/12th (unless dignified)
* Via Combusta

### **3.2. Moon’s next application decides the story**

This is THE signature of the event.

Ideal next aspects:

* to Venus
* to Jupiter
* to the Sun (with reception)
* to the Ascendant’s ruler

Avoid next aspects:

* to Mars
* to Saturn
* to a combust planet
* to an afflicted planet

### **3.3. Use of translation or collection**

If significators do not aspect each other, the Moon or Mercury/Venus may “bring them together.”

---

## **4. The Benefics and Malefics**

### **4.1. Venus**

Best when:

* direct
* visible
* not combust
* in dignity (Taurus, Libra, Pisces)
* succedent or angular

Worst when:

* in fall/detriment
* square Saturn without reception
* combust

### **4.2. Jupiter**

Best when:

* in dignity (Sag, Pis)
* direct
* not cadent
* not afflicted

Worst when:

* retrograde + cadent
* in detriment
* ruling the Moon while weak

### **4.3. Saturn**

May help when:

* dignified
* in sect
* succedent
* receiving the Moon

Hurts when:

* angular
* in the 1st or 7th
* combust (unless cazimi)
* opposing the Moon

### **4.4. Mars**

May assist when:

* in sect
* in dignity (Aries, Scorpio)
* succedent

Hurts when:

* angular
* square or opposite the Moon
* ruling the Ascendant in a marriage or diplomacy-related election

---

## **5. Placement of Planets by House (General Rules)**

### **5.1. Houses to Avoid for Key Planets**

Avoid placing:

* Asc ruler in 6th/8th/12th
* Moon in 6th/8th/12th (unless dignified and intentional)
* Venus/Mercury in 12th
* Malefics on angles

### **5.2. Houses that Strengthen Elections**

1st, 7th, 10th → Show success, visibility
2nd, 5th, 9th → Bring ease and support
4th → Roots, stability, continuity
11th → Wishes granted, supportive friends

Succedent houses (2/5/8/11) give “lasting power.”

---

## **6. Special Rules for Marriage Elections**

### **6.1. Best traditional Ascendant signs for marriage**

* **Libra** (Venus rules → harmony)
* **Taurus** (stable, earthy foundation)
* **Leo** (warm, celebratory)

Avoid:

* Cancer
* Virgo
* Scorpio
* Capricorn
* Pisces

### (These match medieval instructions + avoid native’s bad houses.)

---

### **6.2. Venus must be functional**

Checklist:

✔ Direct
✔ Visible
✔ Free from malefics
✔ Not combust
✔ Not retrograde
✔ Preferably in Taurus/Libra/Pisces
✔ Applying to Moon, Jupiter, or Asc ruler

If Venus is harmed → do not elect.

---

### **6.3. The Moon’s condition is THE marriage signature**

Ideal Moon placements:

* In Taurus, Cancer, Libra, Pisces
* Succedent or angular (but not 6th/8th/12th)
* Applying to benefics

Avoid:

* Moon applying to Mars
* Moon applying to Saturn (unless received)
* Moon void
* Moon in Via Combusta
* Moon in 6th/8th/12th without dignity

---

### **6.4. The 7th House**

The partner’s significator must be healthy.

Avoid:

* Saturn in the 7th (Bonatti’s rule)
* Mars in the 7th (unless in sect + in dignity)
* Malefics ruling the 7th + afflicted

Support:

* Venus/Jupiter aspecting the 7th ruler
* Moon applying to 7th ruler
* 7th ruler dignified

---

### **6.5. Natal house interactions to avoid**

NEVER place the **election Ascendant** in:

* either partner’s 6th
* either partner’s 8th
* either partner’s 12th

This is the **strictest rule** in medieval marriage elections.

---

### **6.6. Reception creates marriage**

Moon → Venus
Moon → 7th lord
Asc lord → 7th lord
Venus → Asc lord
Moon → Asc

All extremely positive.

---

## **7. Danger Zones ("Do Not Elect If This Occurs")**

* Malefic angularity
* Combust significators
* Moon via combusta
* Merc/Venus retrograde
* Saturn in the 7th
* Asc ruler in 6th/8th/12th
* Moon applying to Mars without reception
* Sun/Venus within combustion when Venus rules Asc
* Moon void of course

These override all lesser considerations.

---

## **8. Useful Techniques (as used in our process)**

### **8.1. Narrowing candidate windows**

A practical workflow:

1. Identify months with **dignified Venus** (Taurus, Libra, Pisces).
2. Check planetary condition for malefic dignity or safety.
3. Select possible Ascendant signs that work for marriage (Libra, Taurus, Leo).
4. Filter Asc signs that are **not** in either partner’s natal 6th/8th/12th.
5. Run through daily Asc transitions for those windows.

This gives a block of usable periods.

---

### **8.2. Screening with your election script**

Your script calculates:

* planetary dignities
* house positions
* Moon aspects
* malefic conditions
* hayz/halb
* synodic conditions
* essential states
* angularity
* combustion/cazimi

This is ideal for:

* scanning large date windows
* discarding bad charts fast
* identifying promising candidates

---

### **8.3. Final Stage Analysis**

Once a window is narrowed:

1. Check Asc → not natal malefic houses
2. Check Moon → dignity + next aspect
3. Check Venus → dignity + safety
4. Check malefics → controlled
5. Check 1st and 7th rulers → functional
6. Check angles → no malefics
7. Check receptions → soften hard aspects
8. FINALIZE TOP PICKS
9. Run minute-by-minute refinement

This yields exact election times.
